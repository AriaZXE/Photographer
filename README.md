To take photos with a calibrated camera

This program first checks if a folder named "images" exists, and if not, it creates this folder. Then, by pressing the 's' key, it captures an image and saves it in the specified folder. Each time the program is executed, it continues numbering the images, for example:

 img1, img2, stop and run again, img3, ...

To close the program, press the 'q' key

## ! Please note that currently, it is set up for testing with a webcam, and the input should be changed for the actual camera.
